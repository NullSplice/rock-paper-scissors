# Rock Paper Scissors 🎮

## 📖 Overview

A simple implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game built in JavaScript as part of The Odin Project.
This version runs in the browser using prompt() and alert(), and continues until either the player or the computer reaches 5 points.

## ✨ Features

* Random computer selection using **Math.random()**
* Player input through **prompt()** (with validation)
* Score displayed in every prompt along with the last round's result
* Win/lose/tie messages after each round
* First to 5 points declared the winner (final result shown in an alert)

## 🛠️ Technologies

* JavaScript - functions, conditionals, loops, arrays
* HTML5 - minimal boilerplate for script execution

## 🌐 Demo

1. Click https://nullsplice.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/
2. Play directly in prompts + console logs

## 📚 Learning

* How to use **Math.floor()** + **Math.random()** for random selection
* Validating and normalizing user input with **.toLowerCase()** and **.trim()**
* Tracking and updating scores aross multiple rounds
* Using vriables outside functions to preerve game state
* Designing game flow with loops until a condition (first to 5) is met

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Replace **prompt()**/**alert()** with clickable buttons and results shown in the DOM
* Add images/icons for rock, paper, scissors
* Allow custom target score (e.g., first to 3, 5, or 10 points)
* Track match history across multiple games
